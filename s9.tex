\frametitle{Descriptive and Predictive Data Modelling}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Clustering: Grouping similar records together.
    \item Anomaly detection: Identifying multidimensional outliers.
    \item Association rule learning: Detecting relationships between records.
    \item Principal component analysis:  Detecting relationships between variables.
    \item Affinity grouping: Grouping people with common interests or similar goals (e.g., people who buy X often buy Y and possibly Z).
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Predictive Data Modelling}
\begin{itemize}
\item Regression:
A measure of the strength of the relationship between one dependent variable and a series of independent variables.
\item Neural networks: Computer programs that detect patterns, make predictions and learn.
\item Decision trees: Tree-shaped diagrams in which each branch represents a probable occurrence.
\item Support vector machines: Supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms.
\end{itemize}
